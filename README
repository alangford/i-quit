This app is to help you quit smoking!
the layout is custom made with bootstrap
it will store your days, reasons to quit and images to local storage
i used angular for most of the data
most of the JS is built in ES6 but gulp translated it for me
i used timeAgo for the local time and date
i used ui-router for the three different views
and I used an api service to call for a random inspiring quote
i also built a custom directive that displays a motivational message if you choosed yes at the begining
thank you
